                    <p>We say: EXPECT THE WORLD! Greendale Community College prides itself on its 
                        affordable credit hours, manageable campus size, and interesting people. 
                        Did you know actor <strong>Luis Guzman</strong> was once a student here? </p>

                    <p>Founded in 1974, GCC has been a great place for students to acquire the 
                        skills they need to enter the workforce and on your budget. Last year we
                        introduced the "No More Than 64" promise, which means you'll never pay 
                        more than $64 per credit hour. You'll have to buy a calculator just to
                        add up all the money you'll be saving! With over 80 areas of study, 
                        you can explore your interests before deciding on a major. Our academic 
                        and career advisors will help you create a plan you can get behind!

                    <p>Don't forget our beautiful campus! In the middle of the day there are at 
                        least thirty great places to stay in the shade, usually under beautiful 
                        trees and awnings. With all this talk about "hedge funds" in the news, 
                        <strong>we've started our own!</strong> By summer 2010 each of our walkways will be flanked 
                        by a number of decorative hedges.</p>

                        We don't deny your request for admission just because you're SAT or ACT score might
                        have fallen just below the red line or you received a slightly lower grade in 
                        Algebra than you expected. We want to embrace you and bring you into our GCC

                        The most fun activities are our five annual dances. That's right, <strong>FIVE!</strong>
