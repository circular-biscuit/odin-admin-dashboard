                    <p>We say: EXPECT THE WORLD! Greendale Community College prides itself on its 
                        affordable credit hours, manageable campus size, and interesting people. 
                        Did you know actor <strong>Luis Guzman</strong> was once a student here? </p>

                    <h4 class="title">Why Greendale?</h4>
                    <p>Founded in 1974, GCC has been a great place for students to acquire the 
                        skills they need to enter the workforce and on your budget. Last year we
                        introduced the "No More Than 64" promise, which means you'll never pay 
                        more than $64 per credit hour. You'll have to buy a calculator just to
                        add up all the money you'll be saving! With over 80 areas of study, 
                        you can explore your interests before deciding on a major. Our academic 
                        and career advisors will help you create a plan you can get behind!

                    <h4 class="title">Hedge Funds!</h4>
                    <p>Don't forget our beautiful campus! In the middle of the day there are at 
                        least thirty great places to stay in the shade, usually under beautiful 
                        trees and awnings. With all this talk about "hedge funds" in the news, 
                        <strong>we've started our own!</strong> By summer 2010 each of our walkways will be flanked 
                        by a number of decorative hedges.</p>

                    <p>Here at Greendale we focus on providing opportunities for people that are interested in learning.
                        We don't deny your request for admission just because you're SAT or ACT score might
                        have fallen just below the red line or you received a slightly lower grade in 
                        Algebra than you expected. We want to embrace you and bring you into our GCC
                        family. Remember: <strong>You're Already Accepted!</strong></p>

                    <p>Do you like dancing? Who doesn't! We want our students to enjoy their time here at Greendale.
                        The most fun activities are our five annual dances. That's right, <strong>FIVE!</strong> 
                        Five Dances! Every year! And if that wasn't enough, you get a free<strong>(!)</strong> 
                        commemorative T-shirt if you attend all 5 dances! Woohoo!

                         to and from Greendale has never been easier. To aid with your transition away
                          from Greendale, we have developed the "Six Degrees of Preparation" plan to
